They are doing some interesting things on the stellar networks and it’s well known that IBM is going to be launching quantum computing very soon and is partnered with stellar. If you’re into research this rabbit hole might be fun. What’s crazy about stellar is that I’ve been following their ledger and sometimes you see assets with over a trillion dollar market cap. I’m trying to find out if that’s a mistake or not.  So I’m not going to be so bold to assert that trillions of dollars are flowing through stellar without being reported in the news or reflected on coin market cap.

02-ask-the-class,U024GNX9CGM,noname,"Is anyone else having trouble deploying the Lambda function to Lex's chatbot (using Lex's V2 dashboard)?

It seems to me that Lex's V2 sends the prompts in a JSON format that is incompatible with Lambda's and results in the following error:

_*Invalid Lambda Response: Received error response from Lambda: Unhandled*_

This is the JSON input request from Lex to Lambda:

```{
 ""botAliasId"": ""TSTALIASID"",
 ""botId"": ""OMO7ALJD3O"",
 ""localeId"": ""en_US"",
 ""text"": ""I want to convert dollars to BTC"",
 ""sessionId"": ""588212841742221""
}```
However, the JSON code used in testing the Lambda function in Lesson 15.2 looked like this:

```{
  ""messageVersion"": ""1.0"",
  ""invocationSource"": ""DialogCodeHook"",
  ""userId"": ""John"",
  ""sessionAttributes"": {},
  ""bot"": {
    ""name"": ""CryptoConverter"",
    ""alias"": ""$LATEST"",
    ""version"": ""$LATEST""
  },
  ""outputDialogMode"": ""Text"",
  ""currentIntent"": {
    ""name"": ""convertUSD"",
    ""slots"": {
      ""birthday"": ""1978-12-16"",
      ""dollars"": ""10""
    },
    ""confirmationStatus"": ""None""
  }
}```
The new module is based on Lex's V1.

According to the V2 developer guide, Lambda functions are handled differently

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/migration.html>
*Simplified management of Lambda functions*
In the Amazon Lex V2 API you define one Lambda function per language instead of a function for each intent. The Lambda function is configured in the alias for the language and is used for both the dialog and fulfillment code hook. You can still choose to enable or disable the dialog and fulfillment code hooks independently for each intent. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/lambda.html|Using an AWS Lambda function>.

`from eth_keys import keys`
`pk = keys.PrivateKey(private)`

2.2 Import Account
2.3 Paste the `pk` key from Jupyter Lab

Instruction/Task:
Using the starter file and the `stock_tickers` list, update, add, and remove elements according to the instructions. After each action, print the list to confirm that your syntax is correct.
See the following `stock_tickers` list:
`stock_tickers = ['AMZN', 'CSCO', 'FB', 'GOOG','INTC', 'MSFT', 'SQ', 'TWTR', 'WRK']`
1. Update the ticker `'WRK'` to `'WORK'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
2. Add the ticker `'ZM'` to the end of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
3. Add the ticker `'AAPL'` to the beginning of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
4. Add the ticker `'DELL'` so that it appears between `'CSCO'` and `'FB'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
5. Remove the ticker `'INTC'` from the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
6. Remove the ticker `'SQ'` from the list using the `pop()` method. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
7. Slice a section of the list that includes the tickers `'CSCO'`, `'DELL'`, `'FB'`, and `'GOOG'`. Set this equal to a variable called `stock_tickers_slice`. Print the new variable to confirm your code.

Instructions / Tasks:

Open the starter file and complete the following steps. Use the following future value formula for reference:
``` future_value = current_loan_value * (1 + (annual_interest_rate)) ** months_remaining```
1. Create a function called `calculate_future_value` that fulfills the following criteria.
    ◦ The function should take in three arguments: `current_loan_value`, `annual_interest_rate`, and `months_remaining`.
    ◦ The function body should contain the `future_value` formula.
    ◦ The function should return the `future_value`.
1. Call the `calculate_future_value` function, passing the relevant information from the `new_car_loan` dictionary as parameters. Make sure to set the function call equal to a variable called `cost_of_new_car`.
2. Print the `cost_of_new_car`. Round the figure to two decimal places.

1. Using a `for` loop, calculate the total sum of gains and losses for the period. Print the result.
2. Using the `len` function, determine the number of days in the investment period. Set that value equal to a variable called `number_of_days`. Print the value.
3. Use the `sum_list` and `number_of_days` variables to determine the `average_gain_loss_per_day` value. Print that value, rounding it to two decimal places.
Looping Through a Dictionary
Here is the dictionary of portfolio gains and losses for the investment period of February 2019:
```portfolio_gain_loss_dict = {
    ""02-01-2019"": 168.48,
    ""02_04-2019"": 2445.21,
    ""02-05-2019"": 1461.00,
    ""02-06-2019"": -461.98,
    ""02-07-2019"": -3368.62,
    ""02-08-2019"": 427.03,
    ""02-11-2019"": 193.99,
    ""02-12-2019"": 4443.63,
    ""02-13-2019"": 1132.76,
    ""02-14-2019"": -779.18,
    ""02-15-2019"": 3372.93,
    ""02-19-2019"": 604.64,
    ""02-20-2019"": 703.99,
    ""02-21-2019"": -1249.01,
    ""02-22-2019"": 2156.62,
    ""02-25-2019"": 475.81,
    ""02-26-2019"": -250.61,
    ""02-27-2019"": -150.43,
    ""02-28-2019"": -653.08
}```
1. Using a `for` loop, calculate the total sum of gains and losses for the period. Print the result.
2. *Hint:* This total should match the one calculated from looping through the list.
3. Conditionally filter the dictionary to find the days with a gain greater than or equal to $1,000, or a loss of less than or equal to -$1,000. Add these gain or loss values only to either the `big_gains` list or `big_losses` list. Print both lists.
4. Loop through both the `big_gains` and `big_losses` lists to determine whether the days with the big gains were more profitable than the days with the big losses were painful.

Instruction/Task:
Using the starter file and the `stock_tickers` list, update, add, and remove elements according to the instructions. After each action, print the list to confirm that your syntax is correct.
See the following `stock_tickers` list:
`stock_tickers = ['AMZN', 'CSCO', 'FB', 'GOOG','INTC', 'MSFT', 'SQ', 'TWTR', 'WRK']`
1. Update the ticker `'WRK'` to `'WORK'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
2. Add the ticker `'ZM'` to the end of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
3. Add the ticker `'AAPL'` to the beginning of the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
4. Add the ticker `'DELL'` so that it appears between `'CSCO'` and `'FB'`. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
5. Remove the ticker `'INTC'` from the `stock_tickers` list. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
6. Remove the ticker `'SQ'` from the list using the `pop()` method. Print `stock_tickers` to confirm your code.
7. Slice a section of the list that includes the tickers `'CSCO'`, `'DELL'`, `'FB'`, and `'GOOG'`. Set this equal to a variable called `stock_tickers_slice`. Print the new variable to confirm your code.
